* Be respectful with your comments. This is an open source library and is done with love and passion by
every developer involved, been rude (with or without any technical reason) is not acceptable.
* Whatever you are doing, do it because you really want to do it. If you don't want to code it, don't do it.  
* If your code needs to be explained how does it work, maybe you need to re-do it.
* Document how to use your code, not how does it work
